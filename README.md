# FacebookApp
Thanks for taking the time to view my work. This project was very inspirational to me
because as a Jr. web developer this illustrates what i'm capable of and shows me that I
can code the front end of facebook.
 
Challenge(s) I've faced while creating this application.

Optimizing the webpage to work on not only Chrome but also IE and FireFox. Firefox wasn't 
hard, but IE on the other hand is very buggy in my opinion. The grid box I used to display
pictures only shows one image and the pictures I've set to "border-radius: 50%" are not 
smooth and look almost like 8bit images.
